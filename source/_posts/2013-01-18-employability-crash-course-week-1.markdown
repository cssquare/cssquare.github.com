## Course Project

The course is going to be structured around re-creating the wonderful [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) project in Java.

You will work in teams to implement the basic features of Todo.txt (there's always more if we run out!) along with your team members over the six weeks of the course.

## Using VirtualBox

In order to avoid the pain that is configuring development environments, USB sticks have been provided which contain a VirtualBox installer and an image for a virtual machine. The virtual machine is running Ubuntu 12.04 and is pre-configured with all of the software necessary for this course.

* Mount USB
* Use the installer (.dmg for macs, .exe for Windows, linux come talk to me)
* Open up Virtual Box
* Open the virtual box file located in `CS Square` folder
* Adjust some settings..
* Boot it up! Login is `cssquare/cssquare`
