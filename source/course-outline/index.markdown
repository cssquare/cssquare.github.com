### Contact Information
Ian Bishop (<ian.bishop@unb.ca>)

Feel free to contact me at any point with questions pertaining to course materials or any other advising you may need.

## Required Materials
Given the breadth of software required for the course, we were unabled to secure lab resources in time for the course. 

As such, _**a laptop is required**_ for participation in the course.

All other materials, if necessary, will be provided free of charge. This is in the interest of allowing any students who wish to participate the opportunity to do so.

## Course Description
> Designed for 1st and 2nd year students preparing to go out on a co-op workterm, this six week crash course will cover the more practical aspects of professional software development. Be better prepared for the expectations of your potential employers with an overview of source control, testing tools and more.

## Course Goals
* Better prepare you for your first co-op work term or development position
* Provide a structure where you can learn the principles of software engineering through practice
* Peak your interest in writing software for reasons other than money (hopefully!)

## Course Structure

### Week 1

An introduction to `git` and source control. Learn about Github, a collaborative platform for developers everywhere.

We will also be introducing the project of the course and creating teams.

### Week 2

Using automated testing for software. An overview of what you can test vs what you should test and how testing helps you develop software, large and small.

### Week 3

Planning and architecting software. We will talk about how you can conceptualize software and break it down to simple, testable pieces.

### Week 4

Continuing with planning and architecting software, we will discuss how developers can manage their work through creating tasks and bug reports. We will talk about estimating tasks and why it is so hard.

### Week 5

Maintaining software is the largest component of software development. We will overview documentation, refactoring and how you can write readable and comprehensive code for future developers.

### Week 6

Let's take a minute to analyze how teams have done achieving their goals this semester. We will take a look at data that I have collected and see what interesting insights we can find.
